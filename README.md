The present repository contains scripts to preprocess TMS-EEG data to uncover immediate transcranial evoked potentials (iTEPS).

For more information about iTEPS, please see:
The scripts are currently under testing and may change in the future.


**Repository under construction**
Some functions in the External Functions folder are contributed by collaborators (**Martina Bracco and Tuomas P. Mutanen**). When using the scripts, please ensure you provide the appropriate citations to their work outlined in the main code.
