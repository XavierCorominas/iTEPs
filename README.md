The present repository contains **example scripts** to preprocess TMS-EEG data to uncover immediate transcranial evoked potentials (iTEPS).

A **basic preprocessing** (e.g., preprocessing_basic.m) is necessary and sufficient when TMS-EEG data is not contaminated with large physiological and non-physiological artifacts, and iTEPS are visible during evoked responses observed online during TMS experiments. A **advanced preprocessing** (e.g., preprocessing_advanced.m) is necessary and sufficient when TMS-EEG data is contaminated with large muscular or other types of artifacts overimposing to the iTEPS.

The scripts are currently under testing and may change in the future.


Some functions in the External Functions folder are contributed by collaborators (**Martina Bracco and Tuomas P. Mutanen**). When using the scripts, please ensure you provide the appropriate citations to their work outlined in the main code.
