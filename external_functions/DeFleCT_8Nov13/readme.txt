This package contains a Matlab implementation of DeFleCT algorithm and scripts for generating the results of examples shown in the DeFleCT paper,
Hauk and Stenroos: A Framework for the Design of Flexible Cross-Talk
Functions for Spatial Filtering of EEG/MEG Data: DeFleCT. HBM 2013.

The package contains the files
DeFleCT.m
MNestimator.m
PlotMeshData.m
PlotPoints.m
DeFleCT_Example1_ATL.m
DeFleCT_Example2_V1tip.m

These codes are shared in order to help users use or further develop the DeFleCT method; while I have debugged these and tried to make them easy-to-use, there are no checks whatsoever, and there is no guarantee of any kind. If you find a bug or encounter strange behavior not mentioned in the paper, please contact me instead of running to hasty conclusions...

Before using the spatial filters produced with DeFleCT tools, always verify the resulting cross-talk functions e.g. by visualizing them!

Conditions on use:

If you use these codes or derivatives of these codes for producing results for a publication or a thesis, cite the paper and acknowledge the use of these codes.

If you develop these codes further and wish to share them, change the names of modified function, and include a citation to our paper and an acknowledgement to the original codes in the documentation of your codes.

If you wish to use these codes in a toolbox or port these codes to another platform, please do so --- just cite the paper, acknowledge the use, and let me know. And, make sure that your DeFleCT pipeline contains visualization of the resulting cross-talk function!

You are not allowed to use these tools/codes for a commercial purpose.

You are not allowed distribute this package publicly, unless you have a written permission from me to do so. The permission will be granted for including this code in freely available toolboxes.

You are not allowed to use these tools in clinical work.

I hope you'll find use for these tools. Feedback is of course welcome!
